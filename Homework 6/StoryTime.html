<p>There was once a kid who had a pig. He went everywhere with his pig: the market, the school yard,
even breakfast. One day, they went to the pool and jumped right in. After a few minutes,
the pig started getting hungry. After a few minutes, he got pretty hungry. So he and the boy went to get some lunch.
They both ate an apple, and they were full. Directly after, the boy jumped into the pool.
The boy, after a few moments, started to feel pain in his legs. He was having a bit of trouble swimming while his legs were getting
tight, and he was sinking faster and faster. After a few moments, he felt someone grab his arm. It was the pig! He was pulled to the surface quickly, then was
able to bring him to the side. This is when the boy knew, you need to wait before jumping in the deep end. He also learned, pigs can't fly, but they sure can swim!</p>
